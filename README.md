# Greenify
This project has been done using Three.js. Greenify show plants growing when it rains. You can plant seeds too and watch them grow into flowers when it rains. There are birds and the sun. They dissapear during the rain. The clouds are visible always.

## JSON files
The sun, grass are blender generated JSON objects

## .png images
The bee, butterflies, raindrops, clouds are .png files. 
Plane and sphere geometries are used to wrap these images so they can be used in THREE.js

## Technologies used
- Three.js
- OrbitControls.js
- Blender
- jQuery
- css
- underscore.js 

## Gems
- rubygems
- github-pages

## Deployment
Greenify is deployed on gh-pages

### Point to note
This is the very first time I have used Three.js. There are a lot of JSON and png images too. It may be a bit slower than expected.
